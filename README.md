- React (bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))
- React hooks
- Express

Topics explored:
- Semantic HTML
- State management

### TODOs:

- Additional styling: background, custom border, potentially custom scroll bar for to-do list, make forecast easier to read
- Add links to program schedule
- [Stretch goal] Add weather icon to forecast (Potential resource [here](https://developer.weathersourceapis.com/apis/appwx-weather-icons/))
